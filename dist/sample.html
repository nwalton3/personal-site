          <h1>Custom Animation Easing in CSS and JavaScript</h1>
          <p class="intro"><span class="leader">Many have suggested</span> that a good <span class="sc">UI</span> style guide should contain a section on motion. <em>I agree.</em> It should have information about where animation should appear, as well as technical specs on duration and easing. Rachel Nabors has suggested that each project could really use a custom easing function to give it a distinct personality.</p>
          <h2>CSS Easing is Easy</h2>
          <p>This is pretty easy in <span class="sc">CSS</span>. Whether you’re using transitions or animations, you can get custom easing with a cubic-bezier function. Lea Verou has even made it stupidly easy to generate and preview a cubic-bezier easing function at <a href="http://cubic-bezier.com">cubic-bezier.com</a>.</p>
          <h2>JS Easing is NOT</h2>
          <p>If you’re heavy into animation—or even have a slight perfectionist tendency about it—you may find that within a project there are times when it makes sense to use <span class="sc">CSS</span> animation, but other times when JavaScript animation works better. With such a nice <span class="sc">CSS</span> easing function defined, it seems a shame not to apply that to the <span class="sc">JS</span> animations as well.</p>
          <p><em>And you’d be right.</em></p>
          <p>But you’d also be in for some major headaches.</p>
          <p>If you look at the visual representation of the cubic-bezier function, it seems that there must be some good way of translating it into a mathematical function that could then be written directly into a <span class="sc">JS</span> easing function.</p>
          <p>I’ll define a <span class="sc">JS</span> easing function as an algorithm that takes a decimal between 0 and 1 (progress in time) and outputs another decimal, the animation progress that should have taken place at that particular point in time. For example, a linear easing function would simply output the same number as the input, since the animation progress exactly mirrors the timing progress. An easeInOut function might look something like this:</p>
          <pre>function easeInOut ( progress ) {
    if (progress < .5) {
        return Math.pow(2 * progress, 2) / 2;
    } else {
        return (2 - Math.pow(2 * (1 - progress), 2)) / 2;
    }
}</pre>
          <p>The curve for this function looks like this:</p>
          <p>[insert image here]</p>
          <p>It basically uses the the square of the input to ease the beginning and end of the animation. Fundamentally, I put in a number, and after some logic and math operations another number comes out.</p>
          <p>It seems like we should be able to do the same thing with our cubic-bezier function as well. But it’s actually not that easy. It turns out it’s really, really hard (perhaps impossible?) to put an <code>x</code> value in and get a <code>y</code> value out of a cubic-bezier function. This is because calculating the <code>x</code> and the <code>y</code> values takes separate functions, rather than a single function that could be reversed and reduced with algebra.</p>
