List of all projects


# Specimens
## bugs-1
I've been fascinated with insects ever since my freshman Biology class. So when the idea struck me that both _type_ and _bug_ collections contain specimens, I was more than a little enthusiastic. The result is one of my favorite projects I've ever done.

# Jonah
## jonah-1
I usually prefer relief printing to other traditional media, maybe because it seems to fit so well with letterpress printing. This book has 20 linocut illustrations from the book of Jonah, with images and type printed on a Vandercook SP-15 proof press.

# BYU Home Page
## byu-1
The BYU web community was tasked with redesigning BYU's home page, as well as a set of related templates for sites around campus. It was most important to me that we achieve the right mood. We took inspiration from some of the beautiful places around campus, and worked to give the web pages the same sort of dignified, inviting feeling.

# BYU Tickets
## byutickets-1
This redesign moved the BYU tickets site over to the BYU web template design, and focused in on the main purpose of the site: to sell tickets.

# Learning Suite
## ls-1
I worked extesnively with instructional designers and progammers to create the BYU Learning Suite together. I wrote a style guide and created hundreds of page mockups. I also had a big part in writing the CSS for the site. I also train the designers and programmers on best practices for web design and web application programming.
